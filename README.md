# CS350 TA Resource #

This repository is a compilation of notebooks that I use as a resource for the lab sessions as a teaching assistant for CS350: Computer Organisation and Assembly Language Programming taught at the Illinois Institute of Technology Department of Computer Science.


### Contributing and Reuse ###  
Other TAs and students both in class or former are encouraged to contribute to add to to the content of the notebooks or reuse the material as they wish appropriate.

People not related to the class by any means and are still looking at this repo can also help improve it or use it for their own purposes.
